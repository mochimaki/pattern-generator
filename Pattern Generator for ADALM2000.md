Pattern Generator for ADALM2000

This project provides a user-friendly GUI application for the ADALM2000 (Analog Devices' Active Learning Module) to function as an affordable pattern generator. The application allows users to easily configure and generate custom digital patterns through an intuitive graphical interface.

Key Features:
- Intuitive GUI for pattern configuration
- Support for multiple digital channels
- Flexible timing control with various time units (seconds, milliseconds, microseconds)
- Pattern export/import functionality
- Real-time pattern visualization
- Easy-to-use editing tools for pattern modification

The application is built using Python with Flet for the GUI, making it accessible and easy to use for both educational and professional purposes. It transforms the ADALM2000 into a versatile digital pattern generator at a fraction of the cost of dedicated equipment.
